# Task Management Interface (To-Do Style)

This document outlines the design for the Task Management Interface, a core component of the platform allowing users to define, assign, and track work for their agents.

## 1. Core Concept and Inspiration

*   **Analogy & Inspiration:**
    *   The interface is heavily inspired by popular To-Do list applications such as Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do, and Asana, focusing on clarity, organization, and ease of use.
    *   While Trello (Kanban boards) offers another task management paradigm, this design primarily leans towards a list-based approach, which is often more direct for assigning and tracking discrete tasks.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   To provide users with a clear, intuitive, and organized system for creating, assigning, and monitoring the status of tasks delegated to their AI agents.
    *   To bridge the gap between user intention and agent action, making agent capabilities actionable and results trackable.
*   **Integration:**
    *   The Task Management Interface should be seamlessly integrated into the main platform, feeling like a natural extension rather than a separate, bolted-on feature.
    *   It should interact closely with agent management and potentially A2A communication features.

## 2. Key Interface Components & Views

*   **Task Lists / Projects:**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow users to group related tasks for better organization.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Users can create, rename, and delete multiple task lists or "projects" (e.g., "Daily Briefings," "Market Research Q3," "Social Media Content Calendar," "Personal Errands").
        *   A default system-generated list, such as "Inbox" or "General Tasks," will exist for tasks not yet categorized.
        *   Lists can be color-coded or have icons for visual distinction.
    *   **Navigation:** A sidebar or dropdown menu for easy switching between lists.

*   **Task List View (Main View):**
    *   **Purpose:** Display tasks within a selected list in a scannable format.
    *   **Layout:** A vertical list of task items.
    *   **Each Task Item Displays Key Information:**
        *   **Checkbox:** To quickly mark a task as complete.
        *   **Task Title:** Concise summary of the task.
        *   **Assigned Agent(s):** Shows the avatar/name of the agent(s) assigned. Displays "Unassigned" or an "Assign" button if no agent is allocated.
        *   **Status:** A clear visual indicator (e.g., color-coded dot or tag) of the current task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Needs User Review, Completed, Failed).
        *   **Due Date:** (Optional) If set, shown in a human-readable format (e.g., "Tomorrow," "Oct 25"). Overdue dates are highlighted.
        *   **Priority:** (Optional) Visual indicator for priority (e.g., colored exclamation mark for High).
        *   **Sub-task Indicator:** Shows if the task has sub-tasks (e.g., "3/5 sub-tasks done").
        *   **Quick Actions (on hover/focus):**
            *   Mark as complete (redundant with checkbox, but good for accessibility).
            *   Assign/Reassign agent.
            *   Set Due Date.
            *   Delete Task.

*   **Task Detail Pane / Modal:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provide a comprehensive view and editing interface for a single task.
    *   **Activation:** Opens when a user clicks on a task item in the Task List View. This could be a slide-in pane from the side or a central modal.
    *   **Displayed Information & Editable Fields:**
        *   **Task Title:** (Editable)
        *   **Full Description:** (Editable) A larger text area supporting markdown or simple rich text formatting for detailed instructions, context, or links.
        *   **Assigned Agent(s):** (Editable) Interface to assign or change the agent.
        *   **Status:** (Editable by user, but primarily updated by agents) Dropdown to change status if manual override is needed.
        *   **Due Date:** (Editable) Calendar picker.
        *   **Priority:** (Editable) Dropdown (High, Medium, Low, None).
        *   **List/Project:** (Editable) Move task to a different list.
        *   **Sub-tasks:**
            *   View, add, edit, and delete sub-tasks.
            *   Each sub-task can have its own title, checkbox for completion, and potentially its own assignee (if advanced agent collaboration is supported).
        *   **Attachments:**
            *   Upload files (e.g., documents, images, data files) relevant to the task.
            *   Link to external resources.
        *   **Comments / Activity Log:**
            *   A chronological feed of comments from users and updates/logs from the assigned agent (e.g., "Agent X started progress," "Agent Y encountered an error: [message]," "Agent Z posted results").
            *   Users can add their own notes or communicate with the agent (if the agent supports conversational clarification via comments).
        *   **Creation Date:** Read-only.
        *   **Last Updated Date:** Read-only.

*   **Filtering and Sorting Options:**
    *   **Filtering:** Controls (e.g., dropdowns, buttons) to filter the visible tasks in the Task List View:
        *   By Status (e.g., show only "In Progress" tasks).
        *   By Assigned Agent (e.g., show all tasks for "ResearchBot").
        *   By Due Date (e.g., "Today," "Next 7 days," "Overdue").
        *   By List/Project (implicitly handled by list navigation, but could be a global filter).
        *   By Priority.
    *   **Sorting:** Options to sort tasks within the current view:
        *   By Due Date (ascending/descending).
        *   By Priority (High to Low, Low to High).
        *   By Creation Date.
        *   By Task Title (alphabetical).
        *   Manual Sort (Drag and Drop).

*   **"Assign to Agent" Interface:**
    *   **Activation:** When clicking an "Assign" button or the agent field in a task.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   A dropdown, search box, or modal appears listing available agents the user has access to.
        *   Each agent in the list might show its name, avatar, and potentially a brief status (e.g., "Idle," "Busy," "Specialized in X").
        *   Option to assign to a "pool" of agents (e.g., "Any Available Summarizer Agent") if the platform supports capability-based routing and A2A delegation.
        *   Confirmation step for assignment.

## 3. User Flow: Creating and Managing Tasks

*   **Creating a Task:**
    1.  User clicks a prominent "Add Task" or "+" button.
    2.  **Quick Add:** An input field appears directly in the list view, allowing the user to type a title and press Enter. The task is created with default settings (e.g., in the current list, unassigned, no due date).
    3.  **Full Form:** Alternatively, opening the Task Detail Pane/Modal directly to fill in all relevant details (title, description, due date, assignee, etc.).
    4.  **AI-Assisted Input:** The "AI-Assisted Input Generation" feature can be available for the Task Title and Description fields.
    5.  User can assign agent(s) immediately during creation or leave the task unassigned for later.

*   **Editing a Task:**
    1.  User clicks on a task in the list view to open its Task Detail Pane/Modal.
    2.  User modifies any of the editable fields.
    3.  Changes are saved automatically or via a "Save" button.

*   **Organizing Tasks:**
    *   **Drag and Drop:** Users can drag and drop tasks to reorder them within a list or to move them between different visible lists/projects (if shown in a multi-list view or sidebar).

*   **Adding Sub-tasks:**
    1.  Within the Task Detail Pane, there's a dedicated section for sub-tasks.
    2.  User clicks "Add sub-task," types the sub-task title, and it's added to a checklist.
    3.  Sub-tasks can be marked as complete independently.

*   **Setting Reminders/Due Dates:**
    *   Standard calendar date pickers and potentially time pickers.
    *   Options for quick settings like "Today," "Tomorrow," "Next Week."
    *   Platform may generate notifications for upcoming or overdue tasks.

## 4. Agent Interaction with Tasks

*   **Task Intake / Discovery:**
    *   Agents need a mechanism to become aware of tasks assigned to them.
    *   **Push Model:** The platform can actively send a notification (e.g., via a webhook or an internal message queue) to the agent when a task is assigned or modified.
    *   **Pull Model:** The agent can be programmed to periodically query a dedicated platform API endpoint (e.g., `/api/agents/{agent_id}/tasks`) to fetch new or updated tasks.
    *   The chosen model depends on the ADK and agent architecture.

*   **Understanding the Task:**
    *   The agent receives all relevant task information: Title, Description, Sub-tasks (if any), Attachments, Priority, Due Date.
    *   The effectiveness of the agent heavily relies on the clarity and completeness of the task description. Agents will parse this information to determine their plan of action.

*   **Reporting Progress & Status Updates:**
    *   Agents can programmatically update the status of tasks they are working on via API calls to the platform.
    *   **Common Status Transitions by Agent:**
        *   Assignee Accepts -> "In Progress"
        *   Agent encounters an issue -> "Blocked" (ideally with a reason posted to comments: "API limit reached for tool X.")
        *   Agent needs more info -> "Needs User Input" (with a question posted to comments: "Which website should I summarize for the article?")
        *   Agent completes work -> "Completed"
        *   Agent fails to complete -> "Failed" (with an error message in comments: "Could not access required URL.")
    *   These updates are reflected in the task's status field and appear in the Activity Log/Comments section of the Task Detail Pane, visible to the user.

*   **Delivering Results:**
    *   For tasks that produce a tangible output (e.g., a text summary, a generated image file, a list of URLs, structured data), the agent needs a way to deliver this back to the task.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Posting the result as a comment in the task's Activity Log.
        *   Uploading files as attachments to the task.
        *   Filling in a dedicated "Results" field within the task structure (if such a field is defined).
    *   **Notifications:** The platform should generate notifications for users when tasks are completed, have failed, or require their input.

## 5. Workflow & Automation Ideas (Advanced / Future Enhancements)

*   **Recurring Tasks:**
    *   Allow users to set tasks to repeat on a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly on specific days, monthly). A new instance of the task is automatically created at the specified interval.
*   **Task Templates:**
    *   Users can save a task (with its description, sub-tasks, typical assignee category) as a template.
    *   Quickly create new tasks based on these templates.
*   **Simple Rules / Triggers (potential overlap with Agent Loop Orchestration):**
    *   Example: "If a task in 'Drafts' list is marked 'Completed' by 'WriterAgent', then create a new task 'Review Article' in 'Editing' list and assign to 'EditorUser'."
    *   This could be a simple IF-THEN-THAT rule builder within the task management system or handled by higher-level orchestration.
*   **Batch Actions:**
    *   Select multiple tasks and perform actions like "Assign to Agent X," "Set Due Date," "Move to List Y."

## 6. UI/UX Principles for Task Management

*   **Clarity:** The interface must be extremely clear and easy to understand. Users should be able to see at a glance what needs to be done, who is doing it (or needs to do it), and its current status.
*   **Efficiency:** Common actions like adding, completing, and assigning tasks should be very quick and require minimal clicks. Keyboard shortcuts can enhance efficiency.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear visual feedback for user actions. Agent progress and updates should be easily discoverable.
*   **Minimalism & Focus:** Avoid visual clutter. The primary focus should always be on the tasks themselves. Prioritize information and actions based on user needs.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain consistent design patterns with other parts of the platform.
*   **Responsiveness:** The interface should be fast and responsive, even with many tasks.
*   **Customization (Light):** Allow some level of customization, like creating lists, but avoid overwhelming users with too many options that detract from the core functionality.
