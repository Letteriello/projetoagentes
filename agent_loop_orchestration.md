# Agent Loop Orchestration Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for agent loop orchestration on the platform, focusing on how users can control, automate, and manage the execution of their agents, particularly in autonomous or event-driven scenarios.

## 1. Understanding the "Agent Loop" in Context of an ADK

*   **ADK's Foundational Loop:** We acknowledge that a sophisticated Agent Development Kit (ADK), like one potentially from Google, will provide a foundational execution loop for individual agents. This core loop likely handles processes such as:
    1.  Receiving input/stimulus.
    2.  Processing this input with an LLM based on the agent's core prompt and memory.
    3.  Generating an action, which might be a textual response or a call to a specific tool.
    4.  If a tool is called, managing that tool's execution and receiving its output.
    5.  Incorporating feedback/results into the agent's context/memory.
    6.  Iterating this process (e.g., ReAct cycles: Reason -> Act -> Observe -> Reason...) until a goal is achieved or a stopping condition is met.

*   **Platform's Orchestration Layer:** The platform's role is not to reinvent this internal agent execution cycle. Instead, it provides a higher-level orchestration layer that sits *on top of* or *around* the ADK's capabilities. This layer allows users to:
    *   Define **when** and **how** an agent (or a sequence of agents) becomes active.
    *   Set **overarching goals or policies** that guide an agent's autonomous operation over time.
    *   Manage how agents handle **complex sequences of operations**, potentially involving multiple invocations of their core loop or interactions with other agents.
    *   Gain **visibility** into and **control** over these automated processes.

*   **Focus of Platform Orchestration:** The primary focus is on user-defined control over agent initiation, long-term behavior, and handling of multi-step processes, rather than the micro-details of a single thought-action cycle within the agent (which is principally governed by the agent's prompt and the ADK).

## 2. Key Aspects of User-Defined Orchestration

Users can define and manage the following aspects for their agents' automated behavior:

*   **Triggers (Initiating Agent Activity):**
    *   These define the conditions under which an agent or an orchestrated workflow starts.
    *   **Manual Trigger:**
        *   User explicitly initiates an agent via a "Run Agent" button on its management page.
        *   Assigning a task to an agent in the Task Management Interface can also be seen as a manual trigger for that specific task.
    *   **Scheduled Trigger:**
        *   Time-based activation using cron-like expressions or simplified UI selectors (e.g., "Run daily at 9:00 AM," "Run every Monday and Friday at noon," "Run on the 1st of every month").
    *   **Event-Based Triggers:**
        *   **Platform Internal Events:**
            *   *Task System Event:* e.g., "Task 'X' completed in project 'Y'," "New task added to list 'Z' with priority 'High'."
            *   *A2A Event:* Another agent sends a specific request or signal (distinct from a direct A2A task delegation, more like an event notification).
            *   *(Future)* *Data Source Event:* e.g., "New email received in a connected Gmail account that matches filter F," "New file dropped in a monitored cloud storage folder." (Requires specific integrations).
        *   **External Webhook Trigger:**
            *   The platform provides a unique, secure webhook URL for an agent or a defined workflow.
            *   An external service or application can call this webhook (typically via HTTP POST with an optional JSON payload) to activate the agent/workflow.
    *   **A2A Request Trigger:**
        *   Another agent directly invokes this agent as part of its own workflow, requesting a specific service or action. This is a common pattern in multi-agent systems.

*   **Goals and Long-Term Directives (for Autonomous Agents):**
    *   Beyond the core prompt (which defines *how* an agent behaves in a single execution), users can specify persistent, higher-level goals for agents designed for autonomous operation.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "Monitor `[website URL]` for any changes to its pricing page and report them to me via a task." (Agent would need a web monitoring tool and a way to store the last known state).
        *   "Maintain a summarized digest of AI research papers published on arXiv matching keywords `[X, Y, Z]`, update it weekly, and store it in `[document_link]`."
    *   These directives guide the agent's actions when it's triggered (e.g., by a schedule). The agent, using its core loop and tools, would then take steps to fulfill this ongoing goal.

*   **State Management (Orchestration Perspective):**
    *   While the ADK handles detailed short-term and potentially long-term memory for an agent, orchestration settings might influence this:
        *   **Persistence:** Option to "Maintain state across scheduled runs" (e.g., for monitoring tasks) or "Start fresh with each trigger" (e.g., for a daily report generation that doesn't depend on yesterday's exact memory).
        *   **Contextual Payload:** For event-based triggers (especially webhooks), the event payload can be passed into the agent's initial context for that run.

*   **Concurrency, Queuing, and Resource Management:**
    *   **Agent Concurrency:** The platform needs to manage how many instances of a single agent or how many different agents can run simultaneously (based on user's plan, system resources).
    *   **Trigger Queuing:** If an agent receives multiple triggers while it's already busy or at its concurrency limit for that user, new invocations are queued.
    *   **Prioritization:** (Advanced) Potentially allow users to set priorities for different orchestrated workflows.

*   **Conditional Logic & Multi-Step Workflows (Advanced):**
    *   For more sophisticated automation, users might define workflows with simple conditional logic. This moves beyond a single agent's autonomy into mini-application territory.
    *   **Potential Approaches:**
        1.  **Agent-Driven (LLM Reasoning):** The primary agent's prompt is crafted to make decisions based on its inputs or tool outputs, and then it can directly invoke other agents via A2A communication. This keeps the "logic" within the agent's intelligence.
        2.  **Platform-Defined Simple Sequences/Conditions (Visual or Scripted):**
            *   A simple visual builder (e.g., "Trigger -> Agent A -> IF (Output of A matches X) THEN Agent B ELSE Agent C").
            *   A lightweight scripting approach (e.g., using a simplified YAML or JSON-based flow definition).
    *   **Initial Scope Consideration:** For initial simplicity, relying on an agent's internal LLM reasoning and A2A calls might be preferred over a complex visual workflow builder on the platform itself. The platform ensures reliable execution of these A2A chains.

*   **Error Handling and Retry Strategies (Orchestration Level):**
    *   Define default and per-workflow policies for when an autonomously triggered agent run fails:
        *   **Number of Retries:** e.g., "Retry up to 3 times."
        *   **Delay Between Retries:** e.g., "Wait 5 minutes before retrying" (fixed or exponential backoff).
        *   **Fallback Actions / Notifications:**
            *   "If all retries fail, create a task in my 'Failed Automations' list."
            *   "Send an email notification to `[user_email]`."
            *   (Advanced) "Trigger a different 'Error Handler' agent."
    *   This is distinct from error handling *within* a single agent execution (e.g., a tool call failing, which the agent's internal logic/prompt should try to manage). Orchestration-level error handling deals with catastrophic failures of an entire agent run.

## 3. User Interface for Orchestration

*   **Agent Configuration Panel (within Advanced Agent Settings):**
    *   A dedicated "Orchestration," "Automation," or "Triggers" tab.
    *   **Triggers Section:**
        *   UI to add multiple triggers.
        *   For each trigger: select type (Scheduled, Webhook, Event).
        *   Specific configuration for each type (e.g., cron input/schedule builder, display of generated webhook URL, dropdown for platform event sources).
    *   **Persistent Goals Section (Optional):**
        *   A text area for users to define long-term directives for autonomous agents. This complements the core prompt.
    *   **State Management Options:** Checkboxes or dropdowns for state persistence preferences.
    *   **Error Handling & Retry Settings:** Fields to input retry attempts, delay, and notification preferences for failures during orchestrated runs.

*   **Platform Orchestration Overview/Dashboard:**
    *   A section of the platform (e.g., "Automations," "Agent Runs") providing:
        *   **Activity Log:** A chronological list of all triggered/orchestrated agent runs, showing agent name, trigger type, start/end time, status (Success, Failure, In Progress), and links to detailed logs if available.
        *   **Upcoming Scheduled Runs:** A view of agents scheduled to run in the near future.
        *   **Webhook Management:** List of agents with active webhooks, allowing users to view/copy URLs and see recent webhook calls.
        *   **(Advanced Visuals):** If a visual workflow builder is implemented, this area could display diagrams of those flows and their live status.

*   **Simplicity for Common Cases:**
    *   While offering advanced options, common use cases like "run this agent daily" or "trigger this agent with a webhook" should be extremely easy to set up with minimal clicks and clear guidance.

## 4. Interaction with Task Management

*   **Distinct but Complementary:**
    *   **Task Management:** Primarily for discrete, often user-initiated or user-monitored tasks. It's about managing a "to-do list" for agents and users.
    *   **Orchestration:** Focuses on automating agent activity based on triggers, schedules, or events, often for recurring or background processes that don't require direct, constant user oversight for each run.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   An orchestrated agent run might **create tasks** in the Task Management system as part of its output (e.g., an autonomous research agent finds 5 relevant articles and creates 5 tasks, one for each, for the user to review).
    *   Completion of a task (or a task moving to a specific status) in the Task Management system could be an **event trigger** for an orchestration flow (e.g., "When 'Draft Article' task is marked 'Completed' by WriterAgent, trigger 'ReviewAgent' on that article").
    *   An agent assigned a task via the Task Management interface is essentially a manually triggered, single run focused on that task's specifics.

## 5. Considerations for "Loop" in ADK/Platform

*   **ADK's Internal Loop (e.g., ReAct):** This refers to the micro-level iterative process within a single agent execution where the agent reasons, acts (often by calling a tool), observes the outcome, and then reasons again. This is fundamental to how the agent "thinks" and accomplishes complex tasks. The platform generally does not define these internal steps but provides the tools and context the agent uses within its loop.
*   **Platform's Orchestration of Macro-Loops:**
    *   The platform's orchestration initiates and manages these ADK-driven execution sequences.
    *   A single "orchestrated run" might involve many internal ReAct cycles by the agent.
    *   Users can set parameters that influence the behavior or constraints of these macro-loops, such as:
        *   Maximum execution time for an orchestrated run.
        *   Overall goals that require the agent to loop until the goal is met.
        *   Input data (e.g., from a webhook) that serves as the starting point for the agent's processing loop.

The goal of this orchestration strategy is to empower users to build sophisticated, automated agent-based workflows with a balance of powerful capabilities and user-friendly controls, abstracting unnecessary complexity while providing robust control over autonomous operations.
