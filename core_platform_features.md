# Core Platform Features

This document outlines the core features of the agent platform. Each feature is described by its purpose and key characteristics.

## 1. Agent Creation (Beginner and Advanced Modes)

*   **Purpose:** Allow users with varying technical skills to build agents.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Beginner Mode:**
        *   Utilizes a conversational interface where users describe the agent's intended purpose and goals in natural language.
        *   An AI assistant guides the user through the creation process.
        *   The AI assistant suggests appropriate prompts, tools, and configurations based on the user's description.
        *   Focus is on ease of use and abstracting technical complexities.
    *   **Advanced Mode:**
        *   Provides a more detailed and structured interface (potentially form-based or using a simplified scripting/configuration language).
        *   Offers fine-grained control over all agent parameters, including core prompts, tool selection and configuration, memory settings, and logical flows.
        *   Allows for the definition of custom event handlers and complex interaction patterns.
        *   Suitable for users with technical expertise or those requiring highly customized agent behavior.

## 2. Tool Integration (Standard Tools and MCP Tools)

*   **Purpose:** Enable agents to interact with external systems, access information, and perform actions beyond their core AI capabilities.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Standard Tools:**
        *   Support for a curated library of pre-built, commonly used tools (e.g., web search, calculator, calendar access, email sending).
        *   Easy discovery and one-click addition of these tools to an agent.
    *   **MCP (Multi-Capability Platform) Tools:**
        *   Allows integration of more complex, potentially enterprise-specific, or custom-developed tools.
        *   May involve more detailed configuration, authentication setup, and permission management.
        *   Platform provides SDKs or clear specifications for developing MCP-compliant tools.
    *   **Tool Management:**
        *   A clear and secure process for users to add, configure, and grant specific permissions to tools on a per-agent basis.
        *   Secure handling and storage of credentials, API keys, and other sensitive tool-related information (e.g., using a dedicated secrets manager).
        *   Versioning and lifecycle management for tools.

## 3. AI-Assisted Input Generation

*   **Purpose:** Help users formulate effective and optimized prompts, configurations, and other inputs required for agent creation and task definition.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Contextual "Generate" or "Suggest" buttons/features available next to key input fields (e.g., agent's core prompt, tool parameters, task descriptions).
    *   When activated, an AI model analyzes the current context (e.g., agent's purpose, selected tools) and provides relevant, high-quality suggestions.
    *   Users can provide a general idea or keywords, and the AI can help expand or refine it into a more detailed and effective input.
    *   May include features for prompt templating and sharing of effective prompt patterns.

## 4. Task Management Interface (To-Do Style)

*   **Purpose:* Allow users to create, assign, monitor, and manage tasks for their agents in an intuitive way.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Interface inspired by popular To-Do list applications (e.g., Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do, Asana), providing a familiar user experience.
    *   Users can create tasks with titles, detailed descriptions, and add sub-tasks or checklists.
    *   Ability to set priorities, due dates, and recurrence for tasks.
    *   Tasks can be assigned to specific agents or to a pool of available agents based on capabilities.
    *   Agents can autonomously pick up tasks from a queue or be directly assigned.
    *   Real-time updates on task status (e.g., "pending," "in progress," "awaiting input," "completed," "failed").
    *   Agents can attach results, logs, or outputs directly to the corresponding task.
    *   Notification system for task updates and completions.

## 5. Agent Loop Orchestration Strategy

*   **Purpose:* Define, manage, and provide visibility into the execution lifecycle and operational behavior of agents.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   While the underlying Agent Development Kit (ADK) might handle the low-level execution loop (e.g., perceive, plan, act), the platform provides a user-friendly way to understand and influence this loop at a higher level.
    *   **Triggers:**
        *   Definition of triggers for agent activation, including:
            *   Time-based schedules (e.g., run daily at 9 AM).
            *   Event-based triggers (e.g., new email, API call, message in A2A communication).
            *   Manual activation by the user.
    *   **Goal Setting & Policies:**
        *   Allowing users to set overarching goals or operational policies that guide the agent's continuous operation and decision-making.
        *   Configuration of agent autonomy levels (e.g., fully autonomous, requires confirmation for certain actions).
    *   **Lifecycle Management:**
        *   Controls for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming agents.
        *   Configuration of error handling, retry mechanisms, and reporting for agent execution.
    *   **Monitoring & Visualization:**
        *   Visual representation of the agent's current state, recent activity, and historical performance.
        *   Logs and audit trails of agent actions and decisions.

## 6. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Protocol Integration

*   **Purpose:* Enable agents to collaborate, delegate tasks, share information, and coordinate actions amongst themselves, fostering a multi-agent ecosystem.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Protocol Adherence:** Built-in support and adherence to Google's standardized A2A communication protocol.
    *   **Agent Directory/Discovery:**
        *   A directory service or discovery mechanism for agents to find and identify other agents within the platform or a trusted network.
        *   Ability to publish and discover agent capabilities and available services.
    *   **Message Exchange:**
        *   Standardized message formats for requests, responses, information sharing, and event notifications between agents.
        *   Support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns.
    *   **Collaboration Control:**
        *   User controls for defining which agents are permitted to interact with each other.
        *   Granular permissions for the scope of their collaboration (e.g., what types of tasks can be delegated, what information can be shared).
        *   Mechanisms for establishing trust and secure communication channels between agents.

## 7. UI/UX Design Principles

*   **Purpose:* Ensure the platform is user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and efficient to use for all target users.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Simple & Minimalist:**
        *   Clean, uncluttered layouts with a focus on essential information and actions.
        *   Avoidance of visual noise and unnecessary complexity.
        *   Prioritization of content and functionality.
    *   **Intuitive:**
        *   Easy to understand and use without requiring extensive training or documentation.
        *   Consistent use of common design patterns and established interaction models.
        *   Clear navigation and information architecture.
    *   **Apple/Google Inspired Aesthetics:**
        *   High-quality visual design with attention to detail, typography, and spacing.
        *   Smooth and meaningful animations/transitions (where appropriate) that enhance the user experience without being distracting.
        *   A polished, modern, and professional feel.
    *   **Accessibility:**
        *   Adherence to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure the platform is usable by people with diverse abilities.
        *   Support for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and sufficient color contrast.
    *   **Feedback & Responsiveness:**
        *   The system should provide clear feedback for user actions.
        *   The interface should be responsive and performant.
    *   **User-Centric:**
        *   Design decisions are driven by user needs and workflows.
        *   Regular user testing and feedback incorporation.
